# DynamicNeuralNetwork
 Dynamic Neural Network that takes in a input file dataset and allows the user to determine hyper parameters listed below 
  - works with Perceptron class to use backpropagation for learning off of the dataset
  
       /*--------------------------------------------------
       
       *     DYNAMIC HYPER-PARAMETERS (THROUGH USER INPUT):
	     *        1) # of inputs
	     * 				2) # of outputs
	     * 				3) # of nodes in first hidden layer
	     * 				4) # of nodes in second hidden layer
	     *        5) # of nodes in the output layer
	     *        6) (implicit) changing of learning rate in Perceptron class 
	     
		along with choosing # of cycles/epochs to run training for
	     
	       --> To test, changefilename below w/correct file path
	     
	     -----------------------------------------------------*/
	     
	     
This allows for easy restructuring of the Neural Network architecture for fine tuning of training/learning
